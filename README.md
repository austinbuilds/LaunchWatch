# LaunchWatch

LaunchWatch is an API mashup using four APIs to provide recent & future Space X launch data. Information displayed includes rocket data, mission description, mission status, & location & countdown to next launch. The site is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & JQuery. The focus of the sites development was practice with AJAX, & parsing JSON from API requests. (2018)
